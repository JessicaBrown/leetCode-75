        <h4>consoleLog1 - Merge Strings Alternately</h4>
        You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1.
        If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.
        <p class="how">find the length - loop through - merge into an empty array - return merged array</p>
    </div>

        <h4>consoleLog2 - Greatest Common Divisor of Strings</h4>
        For two strings s and t, we say "t divides s" if and only if s = t + t + t + ... + t + t (i.e., t is concatenated with itself
        one or more times). Given two strings str1 and str2, return the largest string x such that x divides both str1 and
        str2.
        <p class="how">1. check to see if string is divisable (must be able to concat and still be divisable) * AB and ABABAB works but
            AB and ABZD does not
            <br> 2. Euclidean Algorithm - Greatest Common Denominator is found with strings length
            <br> 3. Use substring to pull out denominator

        <h4>consoleLog3 - Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies</h4>
        There are n kids with candies. You are given an integer array candies, where each candies[i] represents the number of candies
        the ith kid has, and an integer extraCandies, denoting the number of extra candies that you have. Return a boolean
        array result of length n, where result[i] is true if, after giving the ith kid all the extraCandies, they will have
        the greatest number of candies among all the kids, or false otherwise. Note that multiple kids can have the greatest
        number of candies.
        <p class="how">find largest number of candies in the array - loop through and add the candies - push true or false to empty array
            and return array</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4>consoleLog4 - Can Place Flowers</h4>
        You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in
        adjacent plots. Given an integer array flowerbed containing 0's and 1's, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty,
        and an integer n, return true if n new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers
        rule and false otherwise.
        <p class="how"> create a variable to keep track of how many you can plant - loop through flowerbed array - set variables prev,curr,next
            to keep track of positions - create logic in loop to make sure no plants are on either side of the index to be
            planted - if can plant add 1 to canPlant array and make that index in flowerbed a 1 - return true or false if
            canPlant is >= to n</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4>consoleLog5 - Reverse Vowels of a String</h4>
        Given a string s, reverse only all the vowels in the string and return it. The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u', and
        they can appear in both lower and upper cases, more than once.
        <p class="how">get array with all the vowels - use original array to replace to keep order - function in the replace pops off last
            index of vow and replaces the first aeiou and so on
